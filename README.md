# Tracker-blocking browser

A simple browser app that:
- Blocks advertisements and trackers on webpages. 
- Allows the user to put a website in a list of allowed domains when the site results broken due the action of the trackers-blocking algorithm and allows to specify the type of breakage.
- Shows a small stats dialog that reports the number of blocked trackers in all sessions.

The app is revolving around the concept of privacy, so many of the design choices are meant to follow this principle.
